Orville Wright was at the controls; Wilbur Wright balanced the
machine at the take-off. This picture records for posterity an
epochal event witnessed by just seven men, the Wright brothers
themselves and five others who, more than they knew, stood that
day on the threshold of history.</p>

<p>The Age of Flight, with its miracle of service, began in an
obscure little bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Here two devoted
brothers, working amid tires, wheels and air pumps,
dreamed that man could fly in a heavier-than-air machine. The
names of these two brothers who wrote themselves indelibly into
history, were Wilbur and Orville Wright.</p>
<p>The story of the Wright brothers is an inspiring narrative of
success. Wilbur and Orville combined to a rare degree the searching
intelligence of the scientist, the ability to visualize of the inventor,
and the practical craftsmanship of the builder. In addition
they had great personal courage.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers were by no means the first who sought the
secret of flight. Particularly in Europe, able men had delved deep
and risked much in the effort to fly like a bird. Certain theories
of aerodynamics had been developed and were generally accepted
as accurate. One of the major setbacks to the hopes of the Wrights
was the discovery, through their own experiments, that these previously
accepted theories were incorrect.</p>
<p>This meant that they had to start from the beginning and develop
their own tables of air pressures. Two developments of the
Wrights made it possible to build an aeroplane that would fly. One
was a crude wind tunnel and the other was an ingenious set of balances
made out of old hack saw blades and bicycle spokes. With
these comparatively crude instruments, they compiled data which
made flight possible.</p>
<p>In the months and years following their first flights, the Wrights
were acclaimed by nations and by men. They knew success in the
fullest measure. But probably no subsequent achievement quite
equaled the thrill which must have been theirs when they were
able to send to their father and sister that now famous message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Success four flights Thursday morning all against twenty-one-mile
wind started from level with engine power alone average
speed through air thirty-one miles longest 59 seconds inform
press home Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wright brothers sprang from pioneers who settled Dayton when
the Ohio country was young. Their father, the Reverend Milton Wright,
became a bishop of the United Brethren Church. His vocation necessitated
frequent changes of residence. Thus it came about that Wilbur
was born April 16, 1867, on a farm eight miles from Newcastle, Indiana,
while Orville was born in a house at 7 Hawthorn Street in Dayton.
This house was the Wright home for more than forty years.</p>
<p>From earliest childhood, the boys
were mechanically minded. They
had both the inclination and the
aptitude for creative work. The pioneering
urge and the gift of original
thinking were theirs.</p>

<p>One day the Bishop came home
from a short trip, bringing the children
a present. He held something
in his hands and then tossed it toward
them. It was a toy helicopter.
Instead of flopping to the floor, it
ascended to the ceiling where it
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
fluttered before it fell. That helicopter set up a milepost in the lives
of the Wright boys. The idea of their future conquest of the air, in all
likelihood, was born then and there.</p>

<p>At an early age they began to fly kites. They became interested successively
in wood cuts, printing and photography. The urge for invention
was strong in them. Wilbur got a job folding the entire issue of
an eight-page church paper. When he found the handwork tiring and
tedious, he designed and built a machine that did the folding.</p>

</div>
<p>Orville was no less enterprising. When he was 15, he entered into
a partnership with Ed Sines, a neighbor boy, and launched the printing
firm of Sines and Wright. The plant was located in a corner of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Sines kitchen. One of their first ventures was to print a little paper
called &ldquo;The Midget.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

vanes. This bicycle was
placed in the Park through
the co-operation of the family
of the late Frank Miller,
former Superintendent of
Dayton Schools.</p>
</div>
<p>Later Orville started a weekly newspaper called the &ldquo;West Side
News.&rdquo; Wilbur joined him as an editorial writer. These publications
and others which followed were printed on a press which the Wright
boys designed and built.</p>
<p>In 1892 came the enterprise that was to provide the setting for, and
the approach to, the supreme adventure with which the names of the
Wright brothers are associated. The boys became absorbed in bicycles.
Orville became interested in track racing and participated in several
events. In their enthusiasm the boys decided to go into the bicycle
business. After embarking on bicycle selling they discovered they must
have a repair shop. Punctures provided the bulk of their business, with
free air as a side issue. The first shop of what became the Wright Cycle
Company was at 1005 West Third Street.</p>
<p>Business increased to such an extent that the Wrights moved to South
Williams Street. Here they began to manufacture bicycles. Their first
model was called the Van Cleve, named after one of their pioneer
Dayton ancestors. Continued expansion of the business necessitated a
move to 1127 West Third Street. This was the shop linked with the
birth and development of aviation. It was here that Wilbur and Orville
not only dreamed of flying but practically built the first plane.</p>
<p>A hint of what the future had in store came one day when the
brothers were discussing what was then the new-fangled horseless
carriage. Since it was an original idea, it appealed to them. Orville suggested
that they might engage in the automobile business. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied
Wilbur, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be tackling the impossible. Why, it would be easier to
build a flying machine.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The first active interest in flying that the Wrights displayed developed
in 1895 when they read about the glider experiments being carried out
by Otto Lilienthal in Germany. They now began to read everything
they could lay hands on that bore on the attempts of man to fly, going
back to the days of the great Leonardo da Vinci. They wrote to the
Smithsonian Institution for a list of books on the subject. The germ of
flying now entered their systems, never to be eradicated.</p>
<p>The Wrights went thoroughly into the problem of gliders. After
Lilienthal had been killed while gliding, the brothers discovered that
neither he nor any other man who glided had an adequate method of
insuring lateral balance. In seeking the solution to this problem, Orville
worked out a theory for the operation to vary the inclination of sections
of the wings, thereby obtaining force for restoring balance. Thus he hit
upon a fundamental principle which became a claim in the original
Wright patent.</p>

<p class="pcap">Many glider flights at Kitty
Hawk preceded the first attempt
to fly in a power-driven
plane. Here the Wrights are
flying a glider as a kite, controlling
it from the ground.
Later flights were made in
man-carrying gliders.</p>
</div>
<p>The brothers now began to study wing structure, but hit upon many
difficulties. A simple incident set them on the right track. In selling a
customer an inner tube for a tire, Wilbur had taken the tube from the
pasteboard box and was idly twisting the box back and forth as he
talked to the customer. In doing so he noticed that although the vertical
sides remained rigid at the ends, the top and bottom sides could be
twisted so that they made different angles at the opposite ends. He immediately
wondered why the wings of a gliding machine could not be
warped from one end to the other in this same way. In this way the
wings could be put at a greater angle at one side than the other and
there would be no structural weakness. Wilbur explained the plan to
Orville and it seemed so satisfactory that they adopted it for their gliders.</p>
<p>The Wrights were now glider-conscious. They built a bi-plane kite
with a new system of controls. In 1900 the brothers constructed a man-carrying
glider. In order to get practice in operation, they decided to
fly it first as a kite. For kite flying they required flat, open country;
and for gliding, sand hills free from trees or shrubs were necessary.
Favorable winds were also needed.</p>
<p>From reports received from the Weather Bureau in Washington, the
Wrights learned that a place named Kitty Hawk in North Carolina
seemed to meet all requirements. So they wrote to the man in charge
of the weather station there for further information. On his and other
data, the brothers came to the conclusion that Kitty Hawk was suitable
for experiments. What was then a tiny spot on the map was to become,
in time, a center of world interest.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Man conquers the air</span></h2>
<p>The spot chosen for the Wrights&rsquo; experiments was located on a long
strip of sandy beach separated from the mainland of North Carolina.
At one point was the Kitty Hawk Life Saving Station and alongside, a
government weather station. A mile back from the ocean was the tiny
village of Kitty Hawk. Four miles south was the Kill Devil Life Saving
Station. Altogether, it was a dreary and uninviting area but one where
history was to be made.</p>
<p>The Wrights&rsquo; experiments at Kitty Hawk covered two periods. In
1900 they began flying gliders. Winds proved to be unsatisfactory with
the result that the experiments of this year fell far below expectations.
They were back in 1901 with a much larger glider. From this model
they learned that large surfaces could be controlled almost as easily as
smaller ones, provided the control was by manipulation of the surfaces
themselves instead of the movements of the operator&rsquo;s body. In their
glider experiments of 1901 they broke all records for distance in gliding.</p>
<p>Air lift still troubled the brothers, so Orville rigged up a small wind
tunnel made out of an old starch box. Within the box was a balance,
the main feature of which was a metal rod that pivoted like a weather
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
vane. The starch box experiment led to the design of the more scientific
wind tunnel shown on <a href="#Page_5">Page 5</a>.</p>

<p class="pcap">Newspaper comments on the early efforts of the Wright brothers.</p>
</div>
<p>In the third glider trials in 1902 the brothers put all their new
knowledge to the test with good results. One new feature was a &ldquo;tail.&rdquo;
The idea of making this tail movable led to the system of control generally
used today&mdash;the independent control of aileron and rudder. The
third series of glider flights was highly successful.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers were now convinced they could build a successful
power flyer. One of the first requirements was an engine to
produce at least eight horsepower and weigh not more than 20 pounds
per horsepower. Unable to obtain such an engine, they built one themselves.
The plane now took shape with wings having a total span of a
little over 40 feet with the upper and lower wings six feet apart. Total
weight of the plane was 750 pounds.</p>
<p>Although the plane was assembled in Kitty Hawk by September 23,
1903, weather and various mechanical mishaps postponed the day of
trial until December 14. On the toss of a coin, Wilbur won the right to
make the first trial. The machine climbed a few feet, stalled and fell.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Several parts were broken, requiring two days for repairs. There were
other minor delays and then came the fateful day of December 17.</p>
<p>This time Orville was the pilot. The few spectators stood silently by,
little realizing that they were participating in an event that would be
&ldquo;forever known.&rdquo; Orville lay flat in the pilot&rsquo;s place with Wilbur running
alongside, a hand on a wing, until the machine left the rail. This,
in the words of one of the historians of the flight, is what happened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signals that all was in readiness were exchanged. The motor turned,
the propellers whirled, a restraining wire was released; the machine
rolled along a crude runway, then took off under its own power and
flew for twelve unbelievable seconds for 120 incredible feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that brief flight, the first ever made by a heavier-than-air
machine, man was freed from the bonds that held him close to Mother
Earth from the beginning of time, and glimpsed the realization of his
oldest, boldest dream ... the conquest of the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment when that homemade plane rose from the ground was
akin to others that heralded epochs in the progress of mankind. Crude
as it was, that first plane represented an almost incredible amount of
preparation. Gliders had been designed, constructed and flown to gain
technical data and piloting technique; a satisfactory system of control
had been discovered; a wind tunnel and balance had been built to
amplify flight data; an aircraft engine sufficiently light in weight had
been developed; and finally an aeroplane had been designed and built.
All these things were accomplished in about three years. As one challenge
followed another, the Wrights met them all and from their first
flight went on to the further development of their invention.</p>

<p>Although the first flight took place at Kitty Hawk, the Wrights
themselves always said that they really learned to fly on Huffman
Prairie east of Dayton on the present site of Wright-Patterson Field.
Having proved that they could fly even if for a maximum of less than
a minute, they now set out to build a more practical and useful machine.
They reasoned that if they could fly 852 feet against a 20-mile
wind as they did in the fourth flight at Kitty Hawk, it should be possible
to build a plane which would fly much farther.</p>
<p>The plane in which the first flight was made was called the Kitty
Hawk. Construction of its immediate successor began in January, 1904.
It was much the same as the one flown at Kitty Hawk but there were
a number of changes and the construction was more sturdy throughout.
This plane was equipped with an entirely new engine. Because of
a shortage of spruce in Dayton they changed to white pine for spar
construction, thinking it would be equally good. However, the pine
broke in actual use and the wings had to be entirely rebuilt.</p>

<p>During 1904 more than 100 flights had been made at Huffman
Prairie. Of those flights, a complete circle made for the first time on the
20th of September and two flights of three miles each were the most
notable. In May of 1905 the Wrights made various improvements in
the machine making it much stronger at various points which had proved
weak when landing in 1904 flights. The warping of the wings and operation
of the tail rudder were made independent of each other and
the camber of the wings was changed. The most important development
was the addition of two &ldquo;blinkers&rdquo; between the surfaces of the
front elevator. The purpose of the blinkers was to assist the rear rudder
in making a turn. This device was patented and proved quite important
for it removed the danger of a tail spin.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers considered their flights of 1905 of great importance,
and the 1905 plane proved through performance that it was
a greatly improved &ldquo;flyer.&rdquo; In a report to the Aero Club of America
dated March 12, 1906, they said this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The object of the 1905 experiments was to determine the cause and
discover remedies for several obscure and somewhat rare difficulties
which had been encountered in some of the 1904 flights and which it
was necessary to overcome before it would be safe to employ flyers
for practical purposes. Toward the middle of September, means of
correcting the obscure troubles were found and the flyer was at last
brought under satisfactory control. From this time forward almost
every flight established a new record.&rdquo; The last flight was the longest
of all, lasting for 38 minutes and 3 seconds and covering 24&#8533; miles.
It ended because of exhaustion of fuel. The gas tank, which held only
about a gallon, had, through oversight, not been full before the take-off.</p>

</div>
<p>The report to the Aero Club continued,
&ldquo;The 1905 flyer had a total
weight of about 925 pounds, including
the operator and was of such substantial
construction as to be able to make
landings at high speed without being
strained or broken. From the beginning
the prime object was to devise a
machine of practical utility, rather
than a useless and extravagant toy....
The favorable results which have
been obtained have been due to improvements
in flying quality resulting
from more scientific design and to improved
methods of balancing and steering....
The best dividends on the labor
invested have invariably come from
seeking more knowledge rather than
more power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The submission of this report was
followed by the adoption of a resolution
by the Aero Club commending the
Wrights upon their accomplishment.
This, it might be said, marked official
recognition on the part of the public
that the Wrights really had flown.
Despite numerous flights made in 1904
and 1905, there was considerable skepticism
and grave doubts on the part of
most people that flights were being
made. In fact, the unwillingness of the
world to believe that man could fly
was one of the ironies of the Wright
story. It was many months before the
last doubting Thomas was convinced
that practical flight had actually been
achieved.</p>
<p>Improvements had been made on the
1905 plane, including the engine. In
1908 the plane was taken to Kitty
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Hawk for further tests. After several successful flights, an accident occurred
which so badly damaged the plane that it was dismantled and
stored there in frame hangars. Over the years parts of the plane were
given to several museums and others were acquired by residents of the
area as mementoes. The engine, the propellers and other parts were
shipped back to Dayton.</p>

<p>When it was decided to reconstruct an early Wright plane for Carillon
Park, the first thought was that it should be a replica of the Kitty Hawk,
which of course would have been accurate in appearance but would
have contained no original parts.</p>
<p>Orville Wright himself suggested that if the original parts of the 1905
plane could be brought together, a plane which could truly be called a
restored Wright aeroplane could be built. An exhaustive search was
begun and with the co-operation of the museums and the residents of
Kitty Hawk, many of the original parts were secured. Orville Wright
located the original drawings and supervised much of the reconstruction.
His death occurred shortly before the plane was finished.</p>
<p>At least 60 per cent of the parts in the plane are original. These
include the engine, the chain guides, control levers and pilot&rsquo;s cradle,
the propellers, the greater part of the wing structure as well as some of
the front rudder struts. Construction of the plane was supervised by
Mr. Harvey D. Geyer, an early employee of the Wrights, who was
uniquely fitted for this responsibility and who, in contributing his services,
has done much to perpetuate the achievements of the Wrights in
their home city. As does the original Kitty Hawk in the Smithsonian
Institution, this restored plane will, for generations to come, help to tell
the story of the genius of the Wrights.</p>

<p>A world that has convinced itself something cannot be done, yields
slowly to the realization that the &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; has been achieved. When
the Wrights approached their own government with the suggestion that
their invention might be useful for scouting purposes their proposal
evoked no interest. Actually, appreciation of the implications and possibilities
of the new device came more quickly from Europe than America.
England and France were among the first to seek information on the
machine that had so thoroughly proved its ability to fly. As early as
1905 a member of the French military had at least made unofficial inquiry
as to the cost of a plane, but for a time this led to nothing.</p>
<p>In 1907 the United States government realized that the Wrights had
proved the practicability of flying. The Signal Corps drew up specifications
and asked for bids. The Wrights offered to build a test plane for
$25,000. Their bid was accepted
in February, 1908. Three months
later they signed a contract with
a French syndicate to sell or license
the use of the plane in
France. The Wrights were now
in the international picture.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">

<p class="pcap">King Alfonso XIII of Spain was keenly
interested in flying, but promised his
family that he would not make flight.</p>
</div>
<p>About this time the Wrights,
always seeking better performance,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
made a notable improvement in their plane. In their first historic
flight and during the experiments on Huffman Prairie, they rode &ldquo;belly
buster&rdquo; just as a boy does when coasting on a sled. They now made a
different arrangement of levers which enabled them to sit up while
piloting the plane. A seat for a passenger was also provided. Interestingly
enough, recent experiments with high-speed planes have brought
some return of the prone position for the pilot.</p>
<p>On May 14, 1908, newspaper men saw a history-making flight at Kitty
Hawk. The remodeled 1905 machine under perfect control carried two
men. Flights for the army followed in September and the last trace of
skepticism disappeared. Unfortunately, on the last flight Lieutenant
Selfridge, the passenger, was killed and Orville severely injured.</p>
<p>The year 1908 was notable in the saga of the Wrights. Wilbur made
a series of flights abroad that not only won all observers but aroused
wide interest and admiration throughout Europe. His quiet demeanor,
his unassuming modesty and his proved skill, stirred the popular imagination.
The French exalted him to the status of a hero. The great of
the world flocked to meet him and see him fly. They included King
Edward VII of England, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, and the Dowager
Queen Margherita of Italy. Invitations to fly came from Rome and
Berlin. In Rome King Victor Emmanuel watched him fly.</p>

<p>In December, 1908, Orville and his sister, Katherine, went to Europe
to join Wilbur. The weather at Le Mans where Wilbur had been flying
became unsuitable for further flights and operations were transferred
to Pau in southern France. Here Orville and Katherine joined
Wilbur. Many flights were made and many distinguished visitors came
to see the modern miracle of human flight.</p>
<p>Honors were heaped upon the Wrights. They received among many
other distinctions, the gold medal of the Aeronautical Society of Great
Britain and the Aero Club of the United Kingdom. The French Aero
Club of the Sarthe gave them a bronze trophy. Later the Aero Club
of America bestowed medals on the flyers. A few weeks afterward,
President Taft received the Wrights at the White House and the
brothers returned to Dayton where a tumultuous welcome awaited them.</p>

<p>Probably nothing stirred the Wrights quite so deeply as their welcome
when they returned to Dayton from their foreign triumphs. The &ldquo;homecoming&rdquo;
lasted two days, June 17 and 18, 1909. Whistles blew, bands
played, bells rang, men, women and children paraded. During the celebration
practically all business in Dayton was suspended.</p>

<p>Wilbur and Orville rode to the celebration in a carriage with their
old friends, Ed Sines, boyhood newspaper partner of Orville, and Ed
Ellis, a long-time friend of Wilbur. The Wrights reviewed a parade in
their honor and in the evening witnessed a spectacular display of fireworks.
The celebration continued the
next day when one of the features was
the formation of a huge living American
flag by 2,500 school children,
wearing red, white and blue.
Immediately after the celebration
Wilbur and Orville left for Washington
to complete the trials for the Army
at Fort Myer. The contract with the
government had specified that the
plane must do forty miles an hour.
Actually, Orville completed one 10-mile
flight in 14 minutes at approximately
43 miles per hour. The Wright
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
plane was accepted by the Army at the conclusion of these tests.</p>

<p>Immediately after the flights at Fort Myer, Orville and Katherine
left for Germany. His purpose was to train pilots for the German
company which had been organized. He made many flights on that
trip, some of them witnessed by members of the royal family and on
one of which the Crown Prince was a passenger. On one he raised the
world&rsquo;s altitude record from 100 meters to 172 meters, roughly 550
feet. Shortly thereafter he flew for one hour, thirty-five minutes and
forty-seven seconds with a passenger, thereby establishing a new world&rsquo;s
record for a flight with a passenger.</p>
<p>While Orville was in Germany in 1909, Wilbur was making spectacular
flights around New York. In one of these he flew 21 miles from
Governor&rsquo;s Island up the Hudson River to Grant&rsquo;s Tomb and back.</p>
<p>To train pilots to fly their planes the Wrights opened a flying school
on Huffman Prairie where those early and precarious flights had been
made. Here a notable group of flyers received their training. One of
them was Henry H. Arnold who became Commanding General of the
Army Air Corps in World War II.</p>
<p>In May, 1910, Wilbur made his last flight as pilot. Shortly afterward
he and Orville flew for a brief time together. It was the only
flight when the brothers were both in the air at the same time. Later
the same day Orville took up his 82-year-old father. In the spirit
of the Wrights the Bishop&rsquo;s only comment was ... &ldquo;Higher! Higher!&rdquo;
Orville&rsquo;s final flight as pilot was made in 1918 from South Field near
Dayton.</p>

prime of life, with a record of achievement privileged to few, passed a
notable figure in American creative history. Orville Wright survived his
brother for 36 years, passing away January 30, 1948. Throughout his
life he maintained his active interest in aviation, was a life member of
the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and a frequent and
honored visitor to Wright Field, the great Air Force research center

<p>The Wright brothers have been honored by many nations. Medals,
trophies, monuments tell in part, at least, the story of their great
achievement. The original Kitty Hawk aeroplane holds the place of
honor in the aeronautical exhibit of Smithsonian Institution, Washington.
A replica of the Kitty Hawk in the Science Museum at South
Kensington, London, speaks for the British nation in honoring the
Wrights. Monuments have been erected at Kitty Hawk, N. C., at
Le Mans, France, and at Dayton. And now Wright Hall with its

<blockquote>
<p><i>In honored memory of Wilbur and Orville Wright, citizens of
Dayton and of the world. Through original research, the Wright
brothers acquired scientific knowledge and developed theories of
aerodynamics which, with their invention of aileron control, enabled
them in 1903 to build and fly, at Kitty Hawk, the first power-driven,
man-carrying aeroplane capable of flight.</i></p>
<p><i>Their further development of the aeroplane gave it a capacity for
service which established aviation as one of the great forward steps
in human progress.</i></p>
<p><i>As scientists, Wilbur and Orville Wright discovered the secret of
flight. As inventors, builders and flyers, they brought aviation to the
world.</i></p>
<p><i>Their courage, perseverance and ability are comparable only to
the magnitude of their achievement. The aeroplane will stand for all
time as one of those few truly great inventions which have shaped
the life and destiny of man.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
